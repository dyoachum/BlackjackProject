## Blackjack Project - Week 4 Skill Distillery

This is my take on the Blackjack application. The project uses multiple classes to bring everything to together in the BlackjackApp.  The user is welcomed with a menu to either play a game with the dealer or to quit the game. If the user chooses to play the dealer will get a new deck, shuffle the deck, and deal the first hand to both the player and the dealer. The user is shown what cards they have and the total value of their hand, and at the same time is shown one of the dealers card.  The user is then given the option to hit or stay. Once the player is happy with their cards the dealer will then try to get a higher total hand value without busting. Once the game is over the user can choose to either play again or to exit the application.

### Lessons Learned

I'm still getting the hang of all the stuff that went into this project but as I kept trying different stuff I figured out what worked and what didn't. Using enums was a brand new thing when this was assigned and I need to go back over that, it seems simple enough but I just want to make sure I fully grasp the concept of them. I'm feeling more confident in a general sense of everything and just need to continue to immerse myself in content that is presented to us in class.
